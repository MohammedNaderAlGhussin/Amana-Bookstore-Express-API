Instructions:
-------------
- Back end =>
    - node js with epress:
        1. you can build an api by creating end points and provide data for the front-end as JSON 
        2. you can build the entire project from the server side and create the HTML Files as EJS

= run the server localy by using listen function. 
= console.log will show in the terminal. 

requests: 
    normal requests requires:
        1. adress => most likely localhost (before production)
        2. port => anynumber ex 3000
        3. path => /api/books
        4. method => get/post/put

    parameters: 
        1. path parameters => sent from the cliend in the request and handeled by the server

            ex: app.get("/findSumm/:num1/:num2", (req, res) => {
                            const { num1, num2 } = req.params;
                            const sum = Number(num1) + Number(num2);
                            console.log(`num1 is ${num1} and num2 is ${num2} and the sum is ${sum}`);
                            res.send("The sum is: " + sum);
                        });

        2. query parameters:  also sent by the client, you also need to write this line in your server side  
                              defined in the link {{baseUrl}}/sayHello?age=50

              ex  app.get("/sayHello", (req, res) => {
                      const { name } = req.body;
                      const { age } = req.query;
                      res.send(`Hello ${name} your age  is: ${age}`);
                  });

        3. body parameters: also sent by the client, you also need to write this line in your server side  

            app.use(express.json()); // to use the body parameters

            ex: app.get("/sayHello", (req, res) => {
                    const { name, age } = req.body;
                    res.send(`Hello ${name} your age  is: ${age}`);
                });

SSR => Rendering the html projects file from the server. 
    you can build the entire project from the server side and send html files as response. 
    ex: 
        app.get("/wlc", (req, res) => {
            res.sendFile(__dirname + "/views/index.html");
        }); 
    => make sure to use the sendFile funtion and to include the correct path
    => best practice is to make a viwes folder. 

Using EJS or any Template Engine:
    => inside the views folder -> the file should be .ejs 
    => to render it in the endpoint use : res.render("filename") instead of sendFile
    => make sure to include app.set("view engine", "ejs"); in the top of the file which makes express know that we are using ejs template engine
    => express assumes that there is a views folder, so if the name was different then express wont find the file to be rendered.
        => so either keep the folder nama views or use  [app.set("views", "./foldername");]
    => inside the .ejs file use <%= ... %> → outputs a value || <% ... %> → JavaScript code, like loops or if statements
